# CunyGlobalScrapper_JS
Web Scrapper retrieves classes available for the Computer Science department of Queens College

Scapper uses puppeteer.js to connect to Cuny Global: https://globalsearch.cuny.edu/CFGlobalSearchTool/search.jsp

Navigates through page 1 & 2 to retrieve list of classes in the Computer Science department of Queens College. 

Note: this project was implemented for a class presentation and serves as a 'proof of concept', it is based of the 
CunyGlobalScrapper_Java project (also found on my github!).
